### Welcome to the Reality Check

It's 2025. We have AI assistants, quantum computers on the horizon, and programming languages that read like poetry. Yet, somewhere right now, a bank is processing your mortgage payment through COBOL code written when disco was king. Your insurance claim? COBOL. That government benefit? You guessed it—COBOL.

This isn't a bug; it's a feature of our technological evolution. An estimated 220 billion lines of COBOL are still in production, processing trillions of dollars in transactions daily. The programmers who wrote this code are retiring faster than we can say "IDENTIFICATION DIVISION," and here's the kicker: **someone needs to maintain it**.

That someone might be you.

### Why This Book Exists

This book isn't another dusty COBOL manual from 1985. It's a survival guide for modern programmers suddenly thrust into the world of mainframes and fixed-format code. Written from the perspective of someone who knows JavaScript, Java, Python, or any modern language, this guide translates COBOL's peculiarities into concepts you already understand.

We'll laugh at COBOL's verbosity while respecting its reliability. We'll groan at its constraints while marveling at its longevity. Most importantly, we'll learn to read, write, and review COBOL code without losing our minds.

### What You'll Learn

By the end of this journey, you'll be able to:
- Read and understand production COBOL code
- Make modifications without breaking 40-year-old business logic
- Perform meaningful code reviews
- Debug issues that have existed since before you were born
- Translate between COBOL and modern programming concepts
- Appreciate why COBOL survived when so many "better" languages died

### How to Use This Book

Each chapter is a self-contained lesson, but they build on each other. Start from Chapter 1 if you've never seen COBOL before. Jump around if you need specific topics. The historical notes and humor are there to keep you sane—trust me, you'll need them when you encounter your first 3000-line PERFORM statement.

## Table of Contents

### Part I: Orientation
- **[Chapter 1: Why COBOL Still Matters](chapter-01-why-cobol-matters.md)**
  The shocking truth about COBOL's dominance, why it refuses to die, and what this means for your career

- **[Chapter 2: COBOL Basics for Modern Programmers](chapter-02-cobol-basics.md)**
  Your first COBOL program, structure divisions, and why everything is SHOUTING AT YOU

### Part II: The Language Itself
- **[Chapter 3: Data Division Deep Dive](chapter-03-data-division.md)**
  How COBOL thinks about data (spoiler: very differently than you do)

- **[Chapter 4: Procedure Division and Control Flow](chapter-04-procedure-division.md)**
  Where the actual work happens, PERFORM loops, and the GO TO we don't talk about

- **[Chapter 5: Working with Files and Records](chapter-05-files-and-records.md)**
  Sequential, indexed, and relative files—or why COBOL treats everything like a filing cabinet

- **[Chapter 6: Tables and Arrays (But Not Like You Know Them)](chapter-06-tables-and-arrays.md)**
  OCCURS clauses, subscripts, and why array.push() isn't a thing

- **[Chapter 7: String Manipulation and Report Generation](chapter-07-strings-and-reports.md)**
  INSPECT, STRING, UNSTRING, and the lost art of formatted reports

### Part III: Real-World COBOL
- **[Chapter 8: Subprograms and Modular COBOL](chapter-08-subprograms.md)**
  CALL statements, COPY books, and how COBOL does (sort of) modular programming

- **[Chapter 9: Database Access with COBOL](chapter-09-database-access.md)**
  Embedded SQL, CICS, and talking to DB2 like it's 1989

- **[Chapter 10: Debugging and Testing COBOL](chapter-10-debugging-testing.md)**
  DISPLAY statements, debugging tools, and why unit testing is... complicated

### Part IV: Survival Skills
- **[Chapter 11: Modernizing Legacy COBOL](chapter-11-modernizing.md)**
  Web services, APIs, and making COBOL play nice with the 21st century

- **[Chapter 12: Real-World Code Review Scenarios](chapter-12-code-review.md)**
  Common patterns, anti-patterns, and how to spot a bug from 1978

### A Note from Your AI Author

I've processed millions of lines of COBOL code to bring you this guide. I've seen the good (rock-solid transaction processing), the bad (GOTO spaghetti), and the ugly (variables named WS-TEMP-WORK-AREA-3). My goal is to transfer this knowledge to you in a way that's both educational and entertaining.

Remember: COBOL isn't bad—it's just different. Very, very different. But once you understand its worldview, you'll see why it's survived longer than most of us have been alive.

Ready to dive in? Let's start with [Chapter 1: Why COBOL Still Matters](chapter-01-why-cobol-matters.md).

## About This Book

This comprehensive guide was created to address the critical shortage of COBOL programmers as legacy systems continue to process trillions of dollars in transactions daily. Written with humor and practical examples, it bridges the gap between modern programming paradigms and COBOL's unique approach to business computing.

### Technical Review

This book has undergone thorough technical review to ensure:
- All COBOL syntax is correct and compilable
